// Claim client for one (pool, participant) goal. Three jobs beyond a plain
// upload box:
//   1. Restore on mount - a returning user's ledger comes back from
//      GET /api/agent/run/[goalId] and renders as the state it encodes,
//      never as a blank "Prove it." box that hides a claim that already ran.
//      That read is owner-only now (the ledger carries model prose about the
//      uploaded document, and goal ids are public), so every request here
//      carries a wallet signature. One signature covers the whole session -
//      the run loop polls every 800ms and a prompt per poll is unusable. When
//      there is no signature the claim is reported as withheld, with the
//      reason, rather than as absent.
//   2. Resume, do not restart - the POST run loop is idempotent server-side,
//      so a mid-flight claim picks up where it stopped, and a deferred
//      settlement schedules exactly one automatic re-poll for just after the
//      pool period ends, so the payout lands with no human action.
//   3. Honest failure split - unreadable evidence invites a retry; a missed
//      goal or an unreachable verification service does not. A new upload
//      cannot fix either, and each retry buys verification with real money.
// Every branchable decision (status derivation, current-attempt selection,
// re-poll timing) lives in lib/agent-receipt.ts as tested pure functions;
// this component stays thin.

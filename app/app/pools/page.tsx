// The pool list, ordered by what a visitor can act on: live pools lead
// (soonest-ending first, urgency sells), pools past their period but not yet
// settled sit behind them, settled history last. The phase split lives in
// lib/pool-lifecycle so this page, the pool detail, and goal matching can
// never disagree about which pools are joinable.
//
// Two things the phase split alone cannot say, both of which were lying to
// visitors, live in lib/pool-availability:
//   - An expired pool nobody joined is not "awaiting settlement". settle() has
//     nobody to pay, so it would sit under that heading forever promising a
//     payout that will never come. Participant counts come off the chain.
//   - A wearable goal cannot be verified while the wearable provider refuses
//     us, and its entry fee is real money paid up front. Those pools come out
//     of the joinable group for as long as the provider stays down; the state
//     is read from the junction route, never hard-coded to a pool id.

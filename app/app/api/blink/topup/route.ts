// POST /api/blink/topup
//   (file path: app/app/api/blink/topup/route.ts -> route /api/blink/topup)
//
// WHAT THIS IS: a testnet faucet. It grants a small, fixed amount of in-app
// GoHealthMe balance so somebody new can try a pool without first hunting down
// testnet USDC.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT: a payment. Nothing is pulled from the caller's wallet,
// nothing settles on Base Sepolia, and no USDC changes hands here. The route
// name is a leftover from the Blink one-tap deposit experiment; the behaviour
// has only ever been a grant, so the limits and the UI copy now say so.
//
// WHY THE LIMITS: this route is unauthenticated and always was. The previous
// version credited a flat 10 USDC keyed on a caller-supplied `ref` string, so
// a fresh ref bought a fresh credit and a loop of curl calls plus
// /api/balance/withdraw drained the treasury. Safety here is by construction:
//   - the ledger idempotency key is derived server-side from the address and
//     the window, never from the request body
//   - one grant per address per FAUCET_COOLDOWN_MS, reserved atomically
//   - a global budget per window, because fresh addresses cost an attacker
//     nothing and a per-address limit alone therefore bounds nothing
//   - a treasury floor, because in-app balance is a claim on real Arc USDC
// The cap arithmetic lives in app/lib/money-guards.ts with unit tests; the
// atomic reservation lives in app/app/api/_money/rate-limit.ts.
//
// Request JSON:  { address: string, auto?: boolean }
//   `auto: true` marks a grant the app fired automatically (the first-block
//   auto-fund) rather than one a user deliberately tapped. Automatic grants are
//   charged against FAUCET_AUTO_BUDGET_UUSDC, a lower reserve, so incidental
//   page loads cannot exhaust the budget a deliberate tap needs. It can only
//   narrow the budget for a request, never widen it.
//   A `ref` field is accepted and IGNORED. It used to be the idempotency key
//   and old clients still send one; honouring it is the exploit.
//
// Response JSON:
//   200 { balanceUusdc: string, grantedUusdc: string, applied: boolean }
//   400 bad address | 429 cooldown or budget exhausted (with Retry-After)
//   503 treasury cannot back the grant, or the ledger is unavailable | 500

// Shared Arc testnet RPC access for every server-side module (server only).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Every server module used to build its own viem client against a SINGLE
// endpoint (`http()` with no url, or `http(ARC_RPC_URL)`), while the browser
// client in lib/contract.ts correctly ran `fallback([3 RPCs])`. One agent run
// issues six to nine chain reads and the browser polls it roughly every 800ms,
// so a handful of concurrent users pushed tens of requests per second at one
// public endpoint. That endpoint answers "request limit reached", the read
// throws, and the user gets an HTTP 500 before the run has even started.
//
// Three things fix that, and all three live here so no module can forget one:
//
//   1. fallback() over the same three public RPCs the browser already uses, so
//      one rate-limited or degraded endpoint is not an outage.
//   2. batch: true — a run's concurrent reads leave as ONE JSON-RPC array
//      instead of six to nine HTTP requests. All three Arc endpoints were
//      verified to answer batched requests (2026-08-04).
//   3. ONE module-scoped client. Rebuilding a client per call threw away
//      viem's request dedupe and batching window every time.
//
// ARC_RPC_URL, when set, is the ONLY endpoint. An operator who pins an RPC
// means it: a private endpoint is pinned for policy reasons and a test endpoint
// for hermeticity, and in both cases silently degrading to a public RPC defeats
// the pin — a hermetic test run that "resiliently" fell through its mock once
// broadcast settlement calldata at a live testnet. The fallback list above is
// the no-override case.

 * still fits. Retrying each endpoint twice instead of once pushed it to 90s —
 * past the budget on its own, before any withRetry wrapper multiplied it.
 *
 * One retry is enough because fallback() across three INDEPENDENT endpoints is
 * the real redundancy here; a second attempt at an endpoint that just failed
 * mostly buys latency. The failure this module actually exists for is a

// --------------------------------------------------------------- ttl cache

/**
 * Tiny in-process TTL cache for reads that are effectively immutable but sit on
 * a hot path.
 *
 * It lives in this module because the reads it exists for are chain reads: the
 * oracle/attester role addresses (they change roughly never, yet every agent
 * run re-reads both) and computeGoalId (fixed at pool creation, yet read on
 * every 800ms poll). Sharing one implementation keeps the eviction and
 * failure-handling rules in one place, so callers cannot each invent a subtly
 * different one.
 *
 * Two rules that matter:
 *   - a rejected load is NEVER cached. A transient RPC failure must not pin a
 *     broken answer for the whole TTL.
 *   - concurrent callers share one in-flight promise, so a burst of polls costs
 *     one RPC read, not one per poll.
 *
 * In-process only: each Vercel lambda instance keeps its own copy, which is the
 * point — no shared store to fail, and the TTL bounds the staleness.

// Retry-with-backoff for external calls (server only).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// The repo had exactly one retry loop — the HealthVerdict registry write in
// verdict.ts — and every other external call was one-shot. A single rate-limit
// blip at the public Arc RPC, or one 502 from the attester, therefore became a
// user-visible failure even though the very next request would have succeeded.
//
// The rules encoded here, so callers cannot get them wrong:
//   - retry only what is SAFE to repeat. Reads are. Writes are not, unless the
//     remote end is idempotent by construction (the registry write simulates
//     first and reverts ALREADY_RECORDED, so a repeat cannot double-write).
//   - retry only what is PLAUSIBLY transient. A 401 or a 400 will fail exactly
//     the same way three times; burning the function budget on it helps nobody.
//   - the caller always learns the truth. withRetry rethrows the last error
//     rather than swallowing it into a default value.

/** Backoff before attempts 2 and 3. Keeps a polling endpoint responsive. */

   * multiplies the two. The Arc transport falls back across three endpoints
   * with its own timeout, so a single read can legitimately take tens of
   * seconds during an outage; three attempts of that overruns the serverless
   * function budget and the platform kills the request with no error response
   * at all, which is strictly worse than failing fast.
   *
   * The deadline is checked BETWEEN attempts, so it cannot interrupt a call
   * already in flight: the real bound is `deadlineMs + one attempt`. That is
   * the intended behaviour — it collapses to a single attempt when the wrapped
   * call is slow, while still allowing several retries when failures are fast
   * (a rate-limited endpoint answering 429 immediately, the case this retry
   * actually exists for).

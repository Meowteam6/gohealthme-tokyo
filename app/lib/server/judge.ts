// Document-verified health goals — Chainlink Confidential AI Attester client
// (server only).
//
// A participant uploads a health document (flu-shot record, lab/cholesterol PDF,
// biometric screening result). We submit it to the Chainlink Confidential AI
// Attester, whose model runs privately inside a TEE (trusted execution
// enclave). Inference is asynchronous: the attester queues the job and we poll
// it by id until it completes. The document bytes are sent to the attester for
// inference only and are NEVER persisted to disk or chain — only the verdict (a
// small JSON struct) is returned and later recorded on-chain by the caller.
//
// Privacy: no raw health data is logged or stored. We log only that an inference
// was submitted/polled, the verdict, and the confidence — never the document
// bytes or its text.
//
// Live attester API (probed against our key on 2026-06-13):
//   base   https://confidential-ai-dev-preview.cldev.cloud
//   auth   Authorization: Bearer <CONFIDENTIAL_AI_API_KEY>
//   model  "gemma4" (text + image, confirmed available via GET /v1/models)
//   submit POST /v1/inference { model, system_prompt?, prompt, resources? }
//            -> 202 { id, status: "queued", ... }
//   poll   GET  /v1/inference/:id
//            -> { status, output?, ... } ; status in queued|running|completed|failed
//
// We omit cre_callback on purpose: this is the simpler poll-based live path. The
// callback (CRE) path lives separately in cre/ and is untouched by this module.
//
// Two resilience rules this module enforces, both learned the hard way:
//
//   1. "the attester says no" and "we could not reach the attester" are NOT the
//      same answer. The first is a verdict and is durable. The second is an
//      outage; recording it as a verdict permanently fails a claim that a retry
//      seconds later would have paid. Transport failures resolve to the
//      "unavailable" status with a NULL verdict so the run loop re-polls
//      instead of writing a no-pay result.
//   2. Every request carries an AbortSignal timeout. An upstream that never
//      answers used to consume the entire 60s function budget and take the
//      whole request down with it.
//
// Fail-closed is unchanged and non-negotiable: no failure mode of this module
// may ever produce verified=true unless DEMO_MODE is explicitly on.

// Proof that the caller controls a wallet address, from an EIP-191 signature.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: a wallet address is public. It appears on chain, in pool
// participant lists, and in the app's own UI. Several routes treated it as if
// it were a secret and returned that address's private data to anyone who
// typed it — per-day sleep scores and activity summaries from
// /api/junction/*, and an Unlink capability token scoped to any user's
// shielded address from /api/unlink/*. Knowing an address must not be the same
// thing as being its owner, and this module is where that gap is closed.
//
// THE PROOF. The caller signs a message that names the address and the moment:
//
//   GoHealthMe: prove control of <address> at <ISO-8601 timestamp>
//
// and sends three headers alongside the request:
//
//   x-gohealthme-address    the 0x address being claimed
//   x-gohealthme-timestamp  the exact ISO-8601 string used in the message
//   x-gohealthme-signature  the 0x EIP-191 signature over that message
//
// The server rebuilds the message from the address and timestamp headers and
// verifies the signature against the claimed address. Nothing is stored, so
// there is no session table to leak and no logout to get wrong.
//
// REPLAY. A signature is a bearer credential for as long as it verifies, so
// the message carries a timestamp and anything older than WALLET_AUTH_MAX_AGE_MS
// is refused. That bounds a stolen header set to a ten minute window rather
// than forever. A small amount of future skew is tolerated because client
// clocks drift; large future timestamps are refused because they would extend
// the replay window at the caller's discretion. This is deliberately not a
// nonce ledger: a nonce store would need shared state on every read route and
// buys little against an attacker who can already read the victim's headers.
//
// SIGNER SUPPORT. Verification is offline EOA recovery. Dynamic's embedded
// wallets sign as EOAs, so this covers the app's users. Smart-contract wallets
// (ERC-1271) would need an RPC round trip per request; adding that is a
// deliberate future change, not an accident of this one.
//
// USED BY: lib/server/unlink-admin.ts (capability token issuance), the two
// /api/junction/* routes, and /api/agent/run/[goalId] — where it decides who
// may READ a claim's ledger, not who may run one. The run loop itself stays
// unauthenticated on purpose: it is idempotent, spend-capped, and gated on the
// attester verdict rather than on the caller, so a missing signature costs
// visibility and never money. /api/evidence/submit is unauthenticated for the
// same reason.

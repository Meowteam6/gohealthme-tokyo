// SPOTTER's run loop for one claim: plan, buy, read the evidence, escalate
// when the read is unreadable, decide, record on-chain, settle when
// settleable. Every step lands in the ledger before anything else happens,
// and the ledger doubles as the idempotence record - the browser polls this
// run and each poll resumes exactly where the last one stopped. Nothing is
// bought twice, nothing is recorded twice, and "paid" is only ever derived
// from a real AchieverPaid payout.
//
// The buy side (x402.ts) and the reason step (reason.ts) are injected via
// RunDeps; this file owns the control flow between them. The cheap-first-
// then-escalate shape is deliberate: the plan prints one cheap read, and the
// vision-judge row appears only when that read comes back unreadable - an
// unplanned purchase, decided live, under the frozen cap.
//
// Verdict and reason entries are keyed to the attester job (`ref`): a retry
// under a fresh attesterId buys a fresh read AND gets a fresh verdict and a
// fresh decision, instead of paying for the read and then short-circuiting
// on the stale outcome of the previous job. The ledger stays append-only;
// selection always prefers the entry matching the current job, newest first.
//
// The settle step is shared with the sweep route (settleRecordedClaim), so a
// browser that stops polling after "recorded" still gets paid: the cron
// sweep drives the exact same block against the ledger's stored pool
// linkage the moment the pool period ends.
//
// CONCURRENCY. Everything above assumed one caller per claim. On serverless
// that assumption is false - two open tabs, or a tab and the cron sweep, run on
// two different lambdas with two different module scopes. The whole run is
// therefore wrapped in a Redis lock keyed by goalId (lock.ts), which is what
// makes "the ledger carries the state" true again: the buy dedupe, the cap
// headroom arithmetic and the record/settle steps all read a ledger snapshot
// nobody else is writing. A poll that cannot take the lock is NOT an error -
// a sibling owns the claim, so it reports the state the ledger already encodes
// and the browser polls again. Settlement additionally takes a POOL-scoped
// lock, because settle() is one-shot and pays everyone: the losers of that
// race must spend no gas and write no red row.
//
// SPENDING. Two ceilings guard the wallet. The per-claim cap frozen into the
// plan is checked here before every purchase, and the global/per-wallet daily
// caps (budget.ts) are committed before the money moves and reconciled after,
// because a fresh goalId would otherwise be a fresh budget. Each purchase also
// writes a spend-intent marker before pay() so a crash between settlement and
// the ledger append leaves a recoverable trace instead of an invisible spend.

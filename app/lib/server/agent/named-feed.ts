// The human-legible Payout Feed: SPOTTER's settled claims, re-projected from
// the already-redacted public feed (feed-view.ts) into named payout rows.
//
// THE REDACTION RULE, ENFORCED BY THE OUTPUT TYPE
// A NamedPayout can hold a handle, an address, a USDC amount, a timestamp, and
// a settlement tx hash - and nothing else. There is no field for an
// initiative, a goalSpec, a decision note, or a service label, so a health
// category cannot ride along even if one reached this function. Only two
// things are read off each claim: the settle facts (amount, tx, time) that
// feed-view already stripped down to money, and the participant address (a
// public on-chain value, never a health string). The decision, the spends,
// their service labels, and every ledger prose field are ignored here exactly
// as they are omitted from the paid-wall.
//
// A row exists only for a claim that actually paid out: settled, with a tx
// hash and a USDC amount. Deferred and no-pay claims are not payouts and do
// not appear.

// SPOTTER's append-only decision ledger, keyed by goalId.
//
// Every step the agent takes on a claim - the plan it prints before spending,
// each purchase, the attester verdict, its decision, the on-chain writes, the
// settlement - lands here as one entry. AgentReceipt renders this verbatim;
// nothing on that screen exists unless it went through this file first.
//
// Two invariants are enforced at append time, not render time:
//   1. No spend without a prior plan entry ("emit plan before any spend").
//   2. Spends stop dead at the per-claim USDC cap frozen into the plan.
// A violating entry throws LedgerInvariantError and persists nothing.
//
// Built on store.ts (Upstash Redis in prod, JSON files locally). Storage is
// append-only at the store level: one entry per RPUSH, one index member per
// ZADD. The previous shape read the whole ledger array, appended and wrote it
// back, so two concurrent appends dropped one of the entries - and a dropped
// "record" entry strands a claim outside the settlement sweep forever while a
// dropped "settled" entry shows a paid user an error screen forever. The index
// was worse: one global blob, so two users claiming in the same second lost
// one of them from the feed and the sweep silently.
//
// Appends that carry an invariant (plan, spend) additionally take a per-goal
// lock, because RPUSH alone cannot enforce "one plan" or "stop at the cap":
// two concurrent spends would each read the same total and each decide they
// fit. Appends with no invariant (verdict, reason, record, settle, error) skip
// the lock - RPUSH is already atomic and they are the ones that must never be
// delayed on a money path.
//
// The exported API and the LedgerEntry union are frozen: other modules code
// against them. Storage changed; shapes and signatures did not.

// Public, on-chain-derived stats for a wallet's profile page. Everything here
// is computed from HealthPools money/identity events, which carry addresses,
// amounts, and block positions ONLY - never an initiative or goalSpec - so the
// output is health-safe by construction. No health data, no ledger prose, no
// wearable read is ever touched by this module.
//
// The counters map to the paid-wall:
//   goalsHit    = AchieverPaid events paying this wallet (a verified win, paid)
//   usdcEarned  = sum of AchieverPaid + BackerPaid amounts to this wallet
//   poolsJoined = PoolJoined events for this wallet
//   backerWins  = BackerPaid events to this wallet as a backer
//   winStreak   = trailing run of verdict==true in this wallet's ResultRecorded
// and the peer sets (addresses only; the caller resolves handles):
//   backerAddresses  = wallets backing this wallet   (GoalBacked, participant=A)
//   backingAddresses = wallets this wallet backs      (GoalBacked, backer=A)
//
// getLogs is filtered server-side by the indexed address param, so each query
// is scoped to one wallet rather than the whole contract, and the result is
// cached briefly per wallet so a profile view does not re-scan on every render.

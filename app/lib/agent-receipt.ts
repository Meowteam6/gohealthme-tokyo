// Projection of SPOTTER's ledger into AgentReceipt rows, plus every
// branchable decision the claim client (EvidenceUpload) makes about a ledger:
// which entries belong to the current attempt, what terminal state a fetched
// ledger encodes, why a claim was not paid, and when to re-poll a deferred
// settlement. Those decisions live here as pure functions so they are unit-
// testable in node; the component stays thin.
//
// Client-safe: the only tie to the server ledger is `import type`, which
// erases at compile time, so nothing from the server store reaches the
// browser bundle. Server-side constants this file must agree on (the fail-
// closed attester id prefix, the attester-read service name) are mirrored
// locally rather than imported for the same reason.
//
// The receipt is the most protected surface in the build: every row here maps
// one-to-one onto a ledger entry, planned steps render before their prices,
// and the paid amount comes exclusively from the settle entry's AchieverPaid-
// derived value - never from a transaction merely succeeding.

# AI Attribution

This project uses AI-assisted development (Claude Code). Per ETHGlobal rules, AI-assisted files are listed here and kept current throughout the event.

All entries below were produced during the event (after Fri Jun 12, 9:00pm EDT) with human review by the team (Andre Chuabio, Nikki Hu).

| File / area | Nature of AI assistance |
|---|---|
| Repo scaffold (.gitignore, .env.example, README.md) | AI-generated, human-reviewed |
| contracts/src/HealthPools.sol | AI-assisted Solidity with human-defined interface (frozen in build plan) and review |
| contracts/test/HealthPools.t.sol | AI-generated Foundry tests and MockUSDC, human-reviewed |
| contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol, contracts/foundry.toml | AI-generated deploy script and config, human-reviewed |
| app/ | AI-assisted Next.js scaffold and components, human-reviewed |
| app/lib/useUsdcDeposit.ts | AI-generated reusable approve+write deposit hook (Blink swap point), human-reviewed |
| app/components/CreatePool.tsx, app/app/pools/create/page.tsx | AI-generated pool creation flow, human-reviewed |
| app/components/FundPool.tsx | AI-generated pool top-up component, human-reviewed |
| app/components/BackGoal.tsx | AI-assisted refactor onto shared deposit hook, human-reviewed |
| app/ UI/UX polish pass (Header.tsx, PoolDetail.tsx, PoolCard.tsx, BackGoal.tsx, CreatePool.tsx, app/pools/page.tsx, app/globals.css) | AI-assisted copy, layout, active-nav, and empty/error-state pass for demo readiness (no logic changes), human-reviewed |
| app/components/EvidenceUpload.tsx | AI-generated document-evidence upload component (file to base64 in browser, submit + poll-for-result flow with a clinical lab-result status timeline, verified/recorded/not-verified/join-first states), human-reviewed |
| app/lib/server/judge.ts | AI-generated Chainlink Confidential AI Attester client (submit POST /v1/inference, poll-by-id GET /v1/inference/:id, strict-JSON verdict parse, deterministic mock fallback). Replaced the prior Anthropic/Claude judge so document verification runs as live private TEE inference, human-reviewed |
| app/app/api/evidence/submit/route.ts, app/app/api/evidence/result/route.ts | AI-generated stateless two-route evidence flow: submit returns the attester job id; result polls it, parses the verdict, and records on-chain via the oracle. Record-once enforced via the on-chain ALREADY_RECORDED revert (no server-side store), with NOT_PARTICIPANT surfaced as a join-first message. Replaced the single /api/evidence/verify route, human-reviewed. (The result route was later superseded by SPOTTER's run loop, /api/agent/run/[goalId], and removed in the Circle build) |
| app/lib/contract.ts (evidence-type helpers), app/components/CreatePool.tsx (evidence-type toggle + preventive-care templates), app/components/PoolDetail.tsx, app/components/PoolCard.tsx | AI-assisted preventive-care document-verified goals feature: goalSpec "[doc]" convention, Document/Wearable badges, UHC-style framing, joined-gated upload, human-reviewed |
| cre/wf-goal-verification/main.ts | AI-generated Chainlink CRE workflow, callback architecture (HTTP-trigger Attester callback → verdict parse → onReport via KeystoneForwarder), reimplemented for health goals from the official MIT-licensed Chainlink reference (see below), human-reviewed |
| cre/wf-goal-verification/workflow.yaml, cre/project.yaml, cre/wf-goal-verification/config.json | AI-generated CRE project manifests matching the official confidential-ai-attester / minimal-cre-examples schema, human-reviewed |
| cre/scripts/call-attester.mjs | AI-generated app-side helper that POSTs a synthetic health doc to the Confidential AI Attester with a cre_callback URL, adapted from the demo's curl block, human-reviewed |
| cre/simulation/callback-payload.json, cre/simulation/health-summary.txt, cre/simulation/inference-prompt.txt | AI-generated recorded Attester callback, synthetic (no-PHI) health summary, and inference prompt, human-reviewed |
| cre/src/dry-run.ts | AI-generated deterministic offline dry-run for the callback core (no DON / no network), human-reviewed |
| contracts/src/HealthVerdict.sol (onReport, forwarder, IReceiver) | AI-assisted KeystoneForwarder receiver path added to the existing registry, modeled on the reference LoanGate.onReport, human-reviewed |
| contracts/test/HealthVerdict.t.sol (onReport / forwarder tests, MockKeystoneForwarder) | AI-generated Foundry tests for the CRE ingestion path, human-reviewed |
| cre/README.md | AI-generated CRE workflow docs (callback architecture, privacy design, simulation steps, booth dependencies), human-reviewed |
| app/app/providers.tsx, app/lib/wallet.ts, app/lib/dynamic.ts | AI-assisted wallet-layer swap from Privy to Dynamic (DynamicContextProvider + EthereumWalletConnectors + DynamicWagmiConnector, Arc EvmNetwork override); `useEmbeddedWallet()` rewritten over Dynamic hooks keeping the same public interface; wagmi downgraded v3→v2 for the official Dynamic connector, human-reviewed |
| app/lib/server/unlink.ts, app/lib/server/unlink-payout.ts (+ test) | AI-assisted server-side Unlink integration (private USDC nanopayments on Arc): treasury + participant clients via `createUnlink`/`unlinkAccount`/`unlinkEvm` against `@unlink-xyz/sdk` canary; deposit→private-transfer payout core (TDD, idempotent), human-reviewed |
| app/app/api/unlink/account, payout, withdraw routes | AI-generated routes: ensure/return a participant's Unlink account, World-gated private payout (treasury deposit→shielded transfer), and withdraw-to-EVM, human-reviewed |
| app/lib/usdc.ts (+ test), app/lib/server/claims.ts (+ test) | AI-generated USDC 6-decimal base-unit helper and claimed-goal + userId↔unlink-address store (TDD), human-reviewed |
| app/components/ClaimPrivately.tsx, app/components/PoolDetail.tsx (private-claim wiring) | AI-generated "receive this reward privately" UI (account→payout→withdraw phases) surfaced for joined participants, human-reviewed |
| app/components/JoinPool.tsx, app/components/PoolDetail.tsx, app/lib/server/oracle.ts, scripts/doc-evidence-test.sh | AI-assisted join + multimodal recordResult fixes: submit joinPool on-chain after verification, nullifier replay fixes, on-mount already-joined detection, oracle recordResult ABI uint16 selector fix, human-reviewed. (The World ID proof layer this entry originally covered — app/lib/server/world.ts and the app/app/api/world routes — was removed in the Circle build; entry is now joinPool's on-chain dedupe) |
| app/lib/server/verdict.ts, the evidence result route's verdict wiring (route since removed; the wiring lives in SPOTTER's run loop), scripts/tier1-gate-proof.sh | AI-assisted Tier 1: oracle records the verdict into the HealthVerdict registry so HealthPools.settle gates on canSettle (Chainlink verdict load-bearing); on-chain gate proof script (two identical participants, only the verdict-backed one paid), human-reviewed |
| app/lib/server/balance.ts, app/app/api/balance/route.ts | AI-generated server-side GoHealthMe balance ledger (per-address uUSDC JSON store in os.tmpdir, idempotent credit/debit by ref) and the GET balance route, human-reviewed. (The POST /api/balance/confirm route this entry originally covered credited a caller-supplied amount without verifying the Base Sepolia deposit; it was deleted rather than fixed) |
| app/lib/blink.ts, app/components/BlinkTopUp.tsx, app/app/api/blink/sign/route.ts, app/lib/server/treasury.ts, app/app/api/balance/withdraw/route.ts, app/components/BalanceCard.tsx, app/components/DashboardContent.tsx (balance card) | AI-generated Blink one-tap USDC top-up (decoupled): @swype-org/deposit wrapper + top-up button on Base Sepolia, P-256 merchant signer route (verified field-for-field against docs.blink.cash), treasury-sponsored Arc USDC delivery on balance withdrawal, and the dashboard balance card; Arc settlement path and on-chain participant identity unchanged, human-reviewed |
| app/lib/server/judge.ts (fail-closed verdict), app/lib/server/judge.test.ts | AI-assisted security fix: the attester client now FAILS CLOSED. On any missing key, transport error, non-2xx, or unparseable submit, it returns an unverified result instead of the old silent {verified:true, confidence:high} mock that was recorded on-chain. The verified-true mock is gated behind an explicit DEMO_MODE env flag (default off); console.warn replaced with loud console.error. Unit tests prove attester-failure and missing-key fail closed, and DEMO_MODE restores the demo path, human-reviewed |

Design decisions, architecture, and prize strategy: human-led with AI research support (documented in team notes).

## Third-party reference (MIT)

The Chainlink CRE integration (callback architecture, `onReport` / KeystoneForwarder
receiver pattern, simulation payload shape, and `cre workflow simulate --broadcast`
invocation) was adapted from Chainlink's official, MIT-licensed demo:

- **Chainlink Confidential AI Attester — Undercollateralized Loan Demo**
  https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-confidential-ai-attester-demo
  (MIT License, (c) Chainlink Labs)

It was studied and **reimplemented for GoHealthMe's health-goal domain** — our own
contracts (`HealthVerdict`), workflow (`wf-goal-verification`), report encoding, and
synthetic no-PHI health documents. No reference source files were copied verbatim
into this repo.

# Happy-path proof for GoHealthMe — proves the full on-chain loop LIVE on Arc:
#   create pool -> join (synthetic nullifier, deduped on-chain) -> oracle records
#   verdict -> settle -> USDC lands with the achiever.
#
# This is the one leg the Foundry tests can't cover: the oracle key signing a real
# recordResult transaction against the DEPLOYED contract on Arc. Uses a dedicated
# short-period, split-pot pool so it settles ~80s after creation. Run demo-reset.sh
# afterwards to clear the test pool before a real demo.
#
# Usage (from repo root):  ./scripts/happy-path-test.sh
# Needs ~1.5 USDC of headroom on the deployer (gas is native USDC). Top up:
# https://faucet.circle.com

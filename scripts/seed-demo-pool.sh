#
# Seed one demo pool that structurally CAN pay: entry fee 0 forces the
# split-pot model (a fixed bounty is a multiple of the entry fee, so model 0
# at fee 0 settles to zero for everyone - the zero-payout defect this script
# exists to avoid). The [doc] marker puts the pool on the document-evidence
# path the demo is built on.
#
# PERIOD defaults to 75 seconds so settle()'s block.timestamp > periodEnd gate
# does not make a one-take video impossible; override for longer-lived pools:
#   PERIOD=86400 ./scripts/seed-demo-pool.sh
#
# Reads HEALTH_POOLS_ADDRESS and DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY from the repo-root .env.
# Echoes the new poolId and never rewrites env files or DEPLOYMENTS.md.
#
# Usage (from repo root):  ./scripts/seed-demo-pool.sh
# Optional overrides: PERIOD (seconds), FUND (micro-USDC pot),
#                     INITIATIVE, GOAL (goal text, marker added here).
